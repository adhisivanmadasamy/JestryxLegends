 * Summary

 Simple yet elegantly complex, introducing the Toby Foliage Engine - Light (TTFEL) - the innovative single-pivot vegetation system that attempts to simulate multiple pivots per mesh, similar to Pivot Painter.
	
 Optimized to perfection, Toby Foliage Engine - Light (TTFEL) shaders provide a comprehensive solution for achieving realistic wind and plant shading. Its seamless integration and user-friendly interface make applying it to any mesh easy. There is no need to worry about conversion or any cumbersome steps as the shaders streamline this process.

 TTFE is an automatic feature that works in conjunction with PBR shading. The wind physics is affected by internal mesh-based vertex position volumes. You can control the size of your volume to mask out wind in your material settings. Similarly, you can modify the behavior of your wind through the material settings.

 These shaders are designed to provide optimal performance and quality for game foliage. They are created using the Amplify Shader Editor to be simple and efficient.

 * Limitations

  X Please note that the light version includes only the essential features and only one basic wind type is available. Amplify shader functions are not available, you can only open the shaders in code. To benefit from all features make sure you download the full version:

  X TTFE is designed to work with instancing, static batching is not supported.
  X Only the latest LTS Unity versions are officially supported.

 * Features

  - "Gentle Breeze" wind type. The global features such as wind and seasons can be adjusted using the "(TTFE) Global Controller".
  - Automatic wind system and adjustable wind mask volumes (mask can be defined in the material settings).
  - Branch bending system.
  - Realistic wind behavior.
  - Fast and performant, good optimization.
  - Real-time season control Including random color.
  - Self-shading (faux-mobile shading).
  - PBR shading.
  - New and Innovative deferred translucency that gets automatically occluded in shadow by a feature called “Translucency Ao”. Works in Built-in, URP, and HDRP (only additional to the diffusion profile In HDRP).
  - Translucency Fluffiness (makes fuzzy-looking grass).
  - Two example scenes.
  - Original assets.
